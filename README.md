# Time-and-Frequency-Domain-Enhanced-Conditional-WGAN-Pretrained-Model-with-RLHF-Fine-Tuning
A model with TS-TCC as the contrastive learning basis, using FCVAE frequency module and CNN + Transformer module for feature extraction. Moreover, using WGAN as the reconstruction based to robustly identify normal data for latent space buiding up.
The context feature is derived by Mask Prediction(Like BERT).
Last but not least, using RLHF as the final fine tuning work for this model.
